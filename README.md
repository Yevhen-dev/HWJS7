Tasks: 

1) Tasks for Math.min and Math.max:
    * Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the lesser of them.
    *  Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns more of them.


2) Tasks for Math.pow:
    * Create a function that raises a number to a given power.Output the result to the console.


3) Tasks for Math.floor and Math.ceil:
    * Create a function that takes a random fractional number and uses Math.floor to round down.
    * Create a function that takes a random fractional number and uses Math.ceil to round up.


4) Task for Date.toLocaleString:
    * Create a Date object for the current date and time.Use the toLocaleString() method to get the current date and time in a human-readable  format.Output the result to the console.


5) Tasks for String.split and toUpperCase:
    * Create a string that contains words separated by spaces.Use the split method to split a string into an array of words.Output the resulting array to the console in uppercase.

6) Rest
    * Create a function that takes the first argument as a string and stores the rest of the arguments in an array using the Rest operator. The function should output a string and an array.
    * Write a function that takes any number of numeric arguments and calculates their average using the Rest operator.

7) TypeOf
    * Create a function that takes an argument of any type and outputs a message about its type using the typeof operator.
    * Create a function that checks the type of a variable and outputs the message "This is a number," "This is a string," or "This is another type" using the typeof operator.

8) Additional tasks
    * Create a function that accepts a date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format and returns the person's age as of today.

    * Create a function that accepts two numbers: min and max, and returns an array of ten random integers between these values ​​(inclusive). These numbers must be unique.

    * Create a function that accepts an array of objects, each of which contains two fields: date (date in YYYY-MM-DD format) and value (numerical value). The function should return a new array containing objects with the largest value for each unique month. Objects should be sorted by month in ascending order.

Practices in using Math, string metods, rest operator and operator typeof.
No issue during the working on code.
