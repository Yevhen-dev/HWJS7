Tasks: 

1) Tasks for Math.min and Math.max:
    * Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the lesser of them.
    *  Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns more of them.


2) Tasks for Math.pow:
    * Create a function that raises a number to a given power.Output the result to the console.


3) Tasks for Math.floor and Math.ceil:
    * Create a function that takes a random fractional number and uses Math.floor to round down.
    * Create a function that takes a random fractional number and uses Math.ceil to round up.


4) Task for Date.toLocaleString:
    * Create a Date object for the current date and time.Use the toLocaleString() method to get the current date and time in a human-readable  format.Output the result to the console.


5) Tasks for String.split and toUpperCase:
    * Create a string that contains words separated by spaces.Use the split method to split a string into an array of words.Output the resulting array to the console in uppercase.

6) Rest
    * Create a function that takes the first argument as a string and stores the rest of the arguments in an array using the Rest operator. The function should output a string and an array.
    * Write a function that takes any number of numeric arguments and calculates their average using the Rest operator.

7) TypeOf
    * Create a function that takes an argument of any type and outputs a message about its type using the typeof operator.
    * Create a function that checks the type of a variable and outputs the message "This is a number," "This is a string," or "This is another type" using the typeof operator.


Practices in using Math, string metods, rest operator and operator typeof.
No issue during the working on code.
